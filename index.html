    <p class="commentary">I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can
        hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through
        with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough,
        and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of
        course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is
        both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five
        minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying
        the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn
        movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!</p>
